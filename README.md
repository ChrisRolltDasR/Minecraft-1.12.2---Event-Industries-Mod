**A Mod in Tribute to the Flat lying Event Industries**

Are you also an event visitor?
I always Searched for a Mod that i can Make a Stage for a Event or Concert in Minecraft more appealing But unfortunately there weren't any!
so..
The events industry has been standing still since the beginning of the pandemic. I've been looking forward for making Minecraft Mods a while ago!

I present the: **Event Industries Mod** for Minecraft *1.12.2*

**Planned features**
- Stage lights
- Pyrotechnic elements
- PA and Speakers
- Instruments and Amps
- Traverse Systems

and everything related to that Industries.

I plan to work with some of some People i know from the Events Industrys to make this mod as extensive as possible.

This mod is a "ONE MAN" project, please note that it may could take some longer time to be published! 
Espacially i not want to Publish a Half Buggy Mess im not okay with! :)

Everything is made with: **MCreator** and 3D Models are done with: **Blockbench**
