# Minecraft 1.12.2 - Event-Industries Mod
A Mod in Tribute to the Flat lying Event Industries

Are you also an event visitor?
I always Searched for a Mod that i can Make a Stage for a Event or Concert in Minecraft more appealing But unfortunately there weren't any!
so..
The events industry has been standing still since the beginning of the pandemic. I've been looking for a long time to create mods for Minecraft which I can do with **MCreator** and Model with: **Blockbench**

I present the: Event Industries Mod for Minecraft 1.12.2

![Event](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84048089/117895874-9c8e4800-b2bf-11eb-8a22-dfdca0f995d1.png)

Planned features.
- Colored redstone lamps
- Pyrotechnic elements
- stage lights
- PA systems
and much more.

I plan to work with some of some People i know from the Events Industrys to make this mod as extensive as possible.

This mod is a "ONE MAN" project, please note that it may could take some longer time to be published! 
Espacially i not want to Publish a Half Buggy Mess im not okay with! :)
