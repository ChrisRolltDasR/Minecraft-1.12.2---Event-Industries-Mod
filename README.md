The events industry has been standing still since the beginning of the pandemic. I've been looking for a long time to create mods for Minecraft which I can do with **MCreator** and Model with: **Blockbench**

I present the: Event Industries Modification for Minecraft 1.12.2

Planned features.
- Colored redstone lamps
- Pyrotechnic elements
- stage lights
- PA systems
and much more.

I plan to work with some of some People i know from the Events Industrys to make this mod as extensive as possible.

This mod is a "ONE MAN" project, please note that it may could take some longer time to be published! :)
Espacially i not want to Publish a Half Buggy Mess im not okay with!
